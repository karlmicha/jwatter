JWatter is a web application modeling and testing framework written in Java. JWatter makes it easy to write automated tests for large, complex web applications. JWatter can be characterized by the following principles: abstraction, automatic low-level page analysis, universal use.

**Abstraction:** JWatter allows you to model a web application as an object hierarchy with methods to interact with the web application UI. JWatter uses the [page object abstraction](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/PageObjects) and provides base classes to model pages, windows and frames, and their relationships.

**Automatic low-level page analysis:** The JWatter toolkit automatically extracts HTML element names and attributes from any web page and generates a low-level Java API to interact with elements in the page. This makes the coding of page classes and automated tests significantly easier and faster, compared to coding directly on top of a browser automation framework such as [webdriver](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium). For example, you can use content assistance and automatic code completion in your favorite IDE to select from all the available actions on a web page, rather than [inspecting HTML source code](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Next-Steps) and looking for tag names and attributes manually.

**Universal use:** JWatter is not yet another browser automation framework. JWatter is built on top of an abstract browser automation framework. This allows you to use JWatter with your favorite browser automation framework. Currently JWatter includes an implementation for [webdriver](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium), and implementations for [Watij](http://watij.com/) and [HtmlUnit](http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/) are in progress.
